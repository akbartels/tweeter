# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This project is my first attempt at executing CSS, jQuery and AJAX while also further practicing my skills in HTML, JS, Node and Express.

I enjoyed having the chance to let my creative juices flow in this project and can't wait to explore my own personal and professional projects in the future!

I hope you like it :)
